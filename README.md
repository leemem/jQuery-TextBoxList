 The base source code check out from [here](https://github.com/nicwolff/jQuery-TextBoxList), but its too old

So,I do some changes :

 >>1. Fix for jquery newer than v1.9 version
 >>2. Add callback function `onResultFormat` for plugin Autocomplete, so you can format your ajax response data 
 >>3. Add delay to keyup event for plugin Autocompleteï¼Œ to fix no-english character (e.g. Chinese character) can not auto match.
